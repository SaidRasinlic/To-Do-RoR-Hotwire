# To-Do-RoR-Hotwire
This is a RoR + Hotwire To-Do List project with basic CRUD operations. The main goal of this application is to understand how Hotwire front-end frameworks (it‚Äôs a suite of different frameworks) works. This application also represents traditional web architecture (server-rendered HTML), without the complexity of modern JavaScript frameworks like React.
